@article{activeLearningMultiLabel,
	Abstract = {Due to technological advances, a massive amount of data is produced daily, presenting challenges for application areas where data needs to be labelled by a domain specialist or by expensive procedures, in order to be useful for supervised machine learning purposes. In order to select which data points will provide more information when labelled, one can make use of active learning methods. Active learning (AL) is a subfield of machine learning which addresses methods to build models with fewer, but more representative instances. Even though AL has been vastly studied, it has not been thoroughly investigated in hierarchical multi-label classification, a learning task where multiple class labels can be assigned to an instance and these labels are hierarchically structured. In this work, we provide a public framework containing baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms suitable for this task. Additionally, we also propose a new algorithm, namely Hierarchical Query-By-Committee (H-QBC), which is validated on datasets from different domains. Our results show that H-QBC is capable of providing superior predictive performance results compared to its competitors, while being computationally efficient and parameter free.},
