\section{Task Definition}
In this section we provide a formal definition of the uni-instance multiclass multilabel problem with a varying number of labels on which we focus in this paper.
\begin{itemize}
\item Give a precise, formal definition of the problem 
\item If appropriate, indicate formally fixed label counts vs.\ varying label counts 
\item If appropriate, indicate formally uni-instance vs multi-instance
\item Give three example instances of the problem (you could be inspired by the datasets that we use later in the paper)
\end{itemize}
